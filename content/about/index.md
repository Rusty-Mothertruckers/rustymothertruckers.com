The **Rusty Mothertruckers** have been gaming together for over a decade in one form or another. Friendships primarily formed online, began over a love of not just gaming, but also game development.

Graham, Jase, and John have all collaborated over the years on different projects, and first came to know each other through sharing tips and advice on gamedev forums. While Dan came later, his enthusiasm for games and game development fit well with the crew and he quickly found himself contributing to various projects where possible.

In the meantime regularly getting together to ["talk shit online and play games"](https://www.twitch.tv/grahamweldon) became a habit, and before we knew it, the Rusty Mothertruckers were born.

Not known for exercising the best judgement, the team have now decided to set themselves a challenge in the first ever [Rusty Mothertruckers Game Jam](https://rustymothertruckers.com/post/20210309-rmgj-announcement/), happening over the Easter weekend from 2-4 April 2021. After multiple rounds of voting, the theme for the game jam will be revealed on Friday night 2 April and the gang will have just a few short days to create a game from scratch.

They'll be [live streaming their progress](https://rustymothertruckers.com/streams/) along the way, and there'll be plenty of activity and shenanigans to follow. Guest collaborators will join them for parts of the weekend, and of course there will be breaks to enjoy some gaming downtime. So please join the **Rusty Mothertruckers** as they prepare to get rusty.
