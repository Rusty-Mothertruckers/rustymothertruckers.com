You can contact us using the form below, but be warned - you do so at your own risk. 

We're encouraging people to mostly use the form as a method of [submitting a theme](/post/20210309-themes-polls-and-voting/), and that is the primary/only real reason we'll be checking what gets submitted here. Odds are good that anything else you send us will be ignored completely. There's a non-zero chance we'll ignore your theme submission as well (if it's bad and we think you should feel bad). 

Go ahead, contact us, we dare you.
