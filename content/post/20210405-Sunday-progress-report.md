## Sunday 8pm (Sydney Time)

It was another huge day of effort from the team, with some real highs and lows. Overall the progress has been really impressive, but there were a few setbacks. Not least of which was Emurga's Blender crash and loss of most of a day's work. Poor guy took it in stride, had some rest and got straight back into it. Amazing resilience and effort.

Jase and Graham both spent the day fleshing out their level creations and drawing elements together to be interactive and playable. Dan defined goals for the different levels and drafted interstitial bits of narration for the transition between levels and locations.

There's a lot left to do, but we've come a long way in a very short time, including the most important piece, a working title!

We're tired but pretty confident we can meet our goal of a playable level (or two) by the end of Monday. Wish us luck! (more importantly, send us caffeine)
