It's the moment we've all been waiting for! (Well the moment the Rusty Mothertruckers have been waiting for) Tonight's the night for our final round of voting for the theme that will be in play for the __FIRST EVER__ Rusty Mothertrucker Game Jam!

##The Final Theme Shortlist

These are the themes that have made it through our first two rounds of voting and are now our final shortlist:

1. Unknown Language
2. Stellar Journey
3. Jased
4. Unbridled Darkness
5. Unicorns

##Vote live for the final theme

Voting will be held during the [normal Rusty Mothertrucker Friday night game stream](https://www.twitch.tv/grahamweldon). There are a few unique parts of the process for this final round of voting. Firstly, you will NOT be able to use Channel Points or Bits to boost your vote in the final poll, this is to level the playing field somewhat and give a better chance to all the remaining themes to be in the running. In order to give as many people as possible the chance to vote we will be running the poll multiple times throughout the stream. This is specifically so that people in different timezones are able to join us and vote around their schedules. This also means that people will have the opportunity to vote multiple times throughout the course of the stream. You will still only be able to vote once each time the poll runs, but if you join us on stream for longer then you will have more opportunities to vote.

The votes from every poll will be tallied, and the total votes over the course of the night will be used to determine the winning theme.

Thanks to everyone who has participated so far, we look forward to you joining us tonight to select the winning theme and officially begin the first ever Rusty Mothertrucker Game Jam!
