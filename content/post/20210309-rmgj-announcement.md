In what some people are calling "an act of extreme hubris" and "a disaster bigger than the Springfield tyre fire" the Rusty Mothertruckers have decided to expand their gaming remit from merely sweary shenanigans playing games, to now include sweary shenanigans while making a game!
<!--more-->

While many traditional game jams are open to all who wish to participate, in this version the Rusty Mothertruckers (and invited guests) will be working together as a team (i.e. Difficulty Setting on AreYouFUCKINGKiddingMe!) to produce a playable game in 48 hours.

The first ever Rusty Mothertruckers Game Jam will be held over the Easter weekend (Friday 2 April 2021 - Sunday 4 April 2021) and will be streamed live while the team are active. Our primary stream is available at <a href="https://twitch.tv/grahamweldon" target="_blank">https://twitch.tv/grahamweldon</a> with additional streaming available at <a href="https://twitch.tv/vereoraus" target="_blank">https://twitch.tv/vereoraus</a>.

Prior to the Game Jam we will be hosting three rounds of voting on our main channel to select a theme that the game has to use. Round 1 will narrow the full list of theme ideas down to a longlist of 10 themes. Round 2 will narrow the longlist to a shortlist of 3 themes. Round 3 will decide the final theme.

Round 3 of the voting will take place during the regular Rusty Mothertruckers Friday Night game streaming session. The gaming portion of the stream will end a little earlier than usual as the result of the final vote is revealed. The Rusty Mothertruckers will then transition into Game Jam mode and begin brainstorming ideas.

[More details on the theme voting are available over here](https://rustymothertruckers.com/post/20210309-themes-polls-and-voting), and as always, if you have any questions for the Rusty Mothertruckers feel free to ask us in chat.

Thanks for reading, and as always, "Fuck you Jase"
