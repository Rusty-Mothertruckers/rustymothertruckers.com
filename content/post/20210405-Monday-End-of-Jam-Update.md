## Monday 9pm (Sydney time)

It's been an intense few days, going from our final theme vote all the way to a playable game since Friday at midnight. There's been a huge amount of work go into this whole project and we are so thankful to everyone who participated. From suggesting theme ideas, to voting, to pitching in and helping with parts of the game, there are so many people we couldn't have done this without. So thank you to each and every person who checked out one of our streams, talked some shit in chat, played some break games with us, or just generally helped us keep going.

## Special Thanks

Special thanks need to go to several people, starting with [Tim Beaudet](https://www.twitch.tv/timbeaudet) whose game [Eggcelerate is available now on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1535490/Eggcelerate/)! It is an excellent, fun, and at times deeply frustrating game (in a good way)! It comes highly recommended by all the Rusty Mothertruckers. Tim is also a cool guy and well worth your time following if you're at all interested in indie game dev.

Next we have to thank Emurga who added a huge capability to our weekend, bringing awesome design skills to the project and helping us create a much more visually impressive game. Emurga also helped us enlist the services of Vvonk who very generously recorded the music for us to use in the game, so big thanks also to Vvonk.

[Lyra])https://www.twitch.tv/misspelledlikexd) is regularly with the Rusty Mothertruckers on stream and we all know how easily she brightens the mood with some quality shit talking, and general cheerfulness. Her support and presence over the course of the weekend was very much appreciated and especially welcomed during game breaks. Graham and Jase still really want her to learn Down With The Sickness on the ukulele, but that is a completely different Game Jam, and honestly, probably one they won't meet the objective on.

Lastly, there have been several people who have dropped by on streams to chat, or joined us in game breaks to help relieve stress and keep the mood fun. So a particular thank you goes out to (in no particular order) giventomeow, ZeroMercuri, ppiness, GrumpyGameDev, and everyone else who helped keep us motivated and awake over the weekend.

## We have an actual game!

We did make it to our goal, which was to have a playable game within 72 hours, so a huge congratulations to the team for accomplishing that. We will be sharing the game with you all shortly, but are working on making it playable in-browser. That will be available shortly, but after some much needed sleep is had.

In the meantime, enjoy this slice of atmospheric beauty.
