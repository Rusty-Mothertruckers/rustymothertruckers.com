## We have an actual game!

It's been an awesome weekend of hard work and some low-key shenanigans to boot. You can [read our post of thanks](https://rustymothertruckers.com/post/20210405-monday-end-of-jam-update/) to catch a glimpse of everyone who helped out with the first ever Rusty Mothertrucker Game Jam.

But the main reason you're here is to see, here and __play__ our creation.

So without further ado, here is the game as it stands on Monday night, after 3 days of continuous effort. It is playable via a download, OR on the web depending on which link you click below.
