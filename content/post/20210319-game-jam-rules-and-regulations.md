Look, every game jam has to have at least some rules, otherwise it's just chaos out there, and the Rusty Anarchist Game Jam is on a different weekend. So here are a few rules and regulations we are going to abide by, unless we decide not to.

## Rules

Rules are defined as things we must adhere to in order to declare victory in our game jam attempt. If we fail to meet these conditions then we will have failed at jamming this game.

1. You can work in a team (we will be trying this - who knows how it will go)
2. You must produce a playable game in 72 hours
3. Your game must be related to the theme
4. You are free to use 3rd party Artwork/Music/Audio/Assets or assets etc. created prior to the game jam

## Regulations

For the purposes of this game jam, regulations are defined as things we will try to do but are not essential to meet the requirements of the game jam. In other words, the regulations are some stupid shit added for our amusement.

1. Prolific swearing is encouraged
2. Sleep deprivation induced hallucinations may occur
3. Guest collaborators can be invited to participate in real-time, and at any time during the game jam
4. The Rusty Mothertruckers must hang shit on each other as often as reasonably possible
5. Substance consumption (primarily caffeine and/or alcohol) in moderation is acceptable
6. Interaction via stream chat is encouraged
