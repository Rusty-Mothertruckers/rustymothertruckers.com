## Round 2 Has Finished

Thanks to all who [joined us on stream last night](https://www.twitch.tv/grahamweldon) to vote in Round 2 of our theme selection process! A lot of fun was had, a few arguments over the merits of various themes, and one or two folks bankrupting their channel points later, and we have our winners!

## The Final Theme Shortlist

The themes that have made it through to our final round of voting are:

1. Unknown Language
2. Stellar Journey
3. Jased
4. Unbridled Darkness
5. Unicorns

## Vote For the Winning Theme Friday 2 April!

The final vote will be held during our [normal stream on Friday 2 April](https://www.twitch.tv/grahamweldon) but with a few unique parts of the process. Firstly, you will **NOT** be able to use Channel Points or Bits to boost your vote in the final poll, this is to level the playing field somewhat and give a better chance to all the remaining themes to be in the running. In order to give as many people as possible the chance to vote we will be running the poll multiple times throughout the stream. This is specifically so that people in different timezones are able to join us and vote around their schedules. This also means that people will have the opportunity to **vote multiple times** throughout the course of the stream. You will still only be able to vote once each time the poll runs, but if you [join us on stream for longer](https://www.twitch.tv/grahamweldon) then you will have more opportunities to vote.

The votes from every poll will be tallied, and the total votes over the course of the night will be used to determine the winning theme.

Thanks to everyone who has participated so far, we look forward to you joining us on Friday 2 April to select the winning theme and officially begin the first ever Rusty Mothertrucker Game Jam!
