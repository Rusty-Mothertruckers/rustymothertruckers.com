# Themes, Polls, and Voting

We will be conducting a [series of polls on stream at](https://www.twitch.tv/grahamweldon) over the coming weeks to determine the final theme for the Game Jam. There will be three rounds of polling, with the first two rounds containing multiple polls.

Before polls commence we invite stream followers to submit theme ideas via chat on our Twitch channel, or [via the form on our site](https://rustymothertruckers.com/contact/). A theme can be broad, or specific, but should avoid being a description of a particular function or mechanic. Ideally a theme will be simple in expresssion but leave plenty of room for interpretation. Some examples of themes are:

* Cooking
* Decaying orbit
* Tiny universe

We will consider all submitted theme ideas but not all suggested themes will be added to the list as we reserve the right to rule out themes that we deem unsuitable for any reason (e.g. are a game mechanic, not a theme; or are racist/homophobic/sexist/etc.). Final submissions must be received no later than midnight AEST Wednesday 17 March 2021.

Voting will be open to all viewers of the stream. The use of channel points to vote will be allowed in the first two rounds of polls, but the final round voting will be limited to ensure the most fair and accurate result possible.

## Round 1 - Friday 19 March 2021

This round will contain the most polls in one night to cull our theme submissions down to a longlist for subsequent voting. The voting options in each poll will be selected randomly to present the options fairly. Each poll will be available for the maximum time available on Twitch (ten minutes). There will be a break between the end of one poll and the beginning of the next.

The winning theme of each poll will be added to the longlist that will form the basis of Round 2 polling.

(We do reserve the right to conduct additional voting off-stream if we deem it necessary in order to get the number of themes down to a suitable number)

## Round 2 - Friday 26 March 2021

This round will contain multiple polls (the exact number to be determined by how many themes are carried over from Round 1) following the same format as Round 1. 

Again, depending on the exact number of themes included in this round we will either take the winning theme, or the top two themes from each poll to include on our final shortlist. The goal of this round is to end up with a **maximum of five themes** to include in our final round of polling.

## Round 3 - Friday 2 April 2021 - AKA the Final Round and the Beginning of the Rusty Mothertruckers Game Jam!

This round will contain the **one poll run multiple times** through the evening with the results of each time being collated to produce the final result.

Once the result has been determined, the theme for the Rusty Mothertruckers Game Jam will be announced and the team will get started on brainstorming ideas and jamming the game.

## List of current theme ideas
