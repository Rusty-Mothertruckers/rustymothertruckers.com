We had a great time last Friday night running multiple polls across our [Twitch Stream](https://www.twitch.tv/grahamweldon) as we completed our first round of voting. It was a great success and we managed to get through 10(!) polls in the night, taking our total number of themes from 46 at the start of the night to 10 semi-finalists.

## Round 1 Voting Results

There were some great tactics employed by various voters making use of channel points and bits to ensure favourite themes made it through to the next round. These are our semi-finalists:

1. Two Worlds
2. Jased
3. Under Pressure
4. Stellar journey
5. Dragons without wings
6. Unbridled Darkness
7. Unknown Language
8. Shaved Apes
9. "Unskilled" Labour
10. Unicorns

## Round 2 Theme Voting Friday 26 March 2021

For the second round of voting we'll be changing our process slightly to reflect the smaller number of themes in total, and to ensure that we finish with the desired number for our final vote that will decide our theme and **LAUNCH THE GAME JAM**!

The key difference is that we will be running **Five** head-to-head polls during the course of our stream on Friday. This means that each poll will eliminate one theme from the list and send the winning theme through to the final vote. This also means that **every poll is critical**!

Because there's so much at stake, and we know that many people have themes they're passionate about seeing through to the final vote, we wanted to give you a chance to prepare ahead of time.

So below is a list of the head-to-head theme matchups. These are the way the themes will be competing on Friday night. Please note that the order below is **NOT** the order they will be appearing on the night (i.e. Matchup 1 will not necessarily be the first poll), so it behooves you (<-- ooh, fancy words!) to [join us on stream early and stick around to make sure your favourite themes get your vote/s](https://www.twitch.tv/grahamweldon).

Without further ado...

## Round 2 Theme Matchups
